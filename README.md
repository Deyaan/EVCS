I have developed an app called EVCS App. As we all know, in the near future, we are going to see maximum numbers of electric vehicles on the road. And charging the vehicles will be a time-consuming process.
So, I have tried to develop an app where the users would be able to get real-time data about the number of vehicles waiting at particular EV Stations, which will help the users to save their time and plan accordingly.

The biggest challenge I faced while creating this app was to source the live data of the number of vehicles present in a particular EV station at that particular time. Finally, I got an idea for the same and I used QR code Technology which would develop QR codes for every EV station in my app dynamically.
I won the Whitehat Jr Silicon Valley Challenge for creating this app. There were over 2000 applicants and I was one of the 6 winners.
